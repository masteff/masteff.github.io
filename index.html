                <h3>engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    In my youth I actually wanted to get a job in the movie industry like probably many young kids. So I got an 
                    internship at a production company as cutter assistant but soon realised that cabling cutting rooms or understanding how a camera actually works
                    was way more interesting for me. With this inspiration my journey in engineering began and I started my studies in optical technologies and after my diploma I advanced my knowledge with
                    a master's degree in applied physics.
                    So by now I am an engineer by heart and have the strong belief that there is now problem in the world that cant be fixed by a bit of thinking and a lot of trial and error ;)
                    But jokes aside, ever since my studies I continously improved my engen skills in every possible field. So as a true engineer
                    I am no expert in a particular field but have a broad knowledge about many engineering disciplines. So although I don't have an answer to every problem
                    right away, at least I probalbly have heard about a soultion before and know what I should look up.

            <div class="service">
                <h3>programming</h3>
                <p>
                    As with engineering I didnt't quite find my love for programming right away. In fact I kind I wasn't a big fan of the programming courses in my engeneering
                    classes. And back in the days for me it was quite boring spending hours to develop a java program that can solve binomial equations.
                    This changed when I was working on my master thesis where I wanted to find the blood concentration in a humans body by spectoscopy.
                    I had to write a program that controls the spektometer, read out ccd and does all kind of data manipulation. So this was when I first realised 
                    what crazy stuff you can do with programming. Ever since I suck in everything in can find about programming. Having basic knowledge
                    in basically every program language there is I find myself most interested in embedded programming which combines my interst interest
                    in electrical engeneeringand programming.

            <div class="service">
                <h3>automating</h3>
                <p>
                    This is worth a new column for me although one could argue that automation is just the combination of the girst two colums. For me though the urge to automate things 
                    almost became like a character trait of me. Don't get me wrong. If I am in a hurry and need quick solutions I would also just copy/paste four blocks of 
                    text into an essay. But while doing so I would constantly think about a way to do this more efficiently.
                    I think trying to automate as much of a process lets you really dig deep and understand the underlying concepts. As well as eleminating any kind of errors
                    human or system wise. But of course I know that automating a lot and trusting to much in machines or code can also cause a lot of trouble.
                    So I am well aware that every system of machines and programming needs strong validation.

        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Test Engineer based in Berlin</p>
        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>
                I am a 38 year old senior quality working for a medical device manufacturer in berlin. 
                I prefer calling myself a test engineer though, because what I actully do is designing, automating and validating methods for testing various kinds of 
                products. I have spent the last 15 years educating myself in many different fields of engineering, work related as well as privatly.
                By now I can call myself almost addicted to new sources of information, like online tutorials or books. 
                So a big part o my private life and hobbies is also concerned with electronics or especially programming. For me his is some kind of kthinking sports
                like puzzles or crowwsowrd puzzles. Other from that I also want to keep my body in shape I do a lot of different sport activieties, both team and individual.
                To get my head clear I like to tkae my mootorbike for a ride. I like to travel a lot. That's why I also like to travel abroad for my job.
