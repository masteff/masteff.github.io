                <h3>egineering</h3>
                <p>
                    Holding a diploma in optical technologies and a master's degree in applied physics, 
                    I have a stong foundation to conquer almost any engeneering challange there is. And while I find myself more at home in electronic
                    or optical fields I always my analytical skills also help me understanding mechanics or other engineering.
                    Having worked for two companies whose products are strongly related to PCBA Design and manufacturing I gained more
                    and more insights in understanding the techical aspects as well as understanding the quality needs of This
                    products.

                <h3>programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Although I dont have a strong educational background in computer sciences I absolutly fell in love with programming over time. And by slowly I really mean that even the obligatory courses at univerity
                    did not interest me a lot. I wouldn't find it very fascinating that I could solve a binomial equation with java and have to admit that i didnt really put much effort in learning
                    vhdl in my erly yers. But this changed with the first projects that I followed for myself and when I realised what kind
                    of cool stuff you can achieve with programming. From my bakcground I am very much interested in embedded programming and do this privatly a lot. I could 
                    defently see myself doing this full time. But I am alo very interested in programming the more artistic site like web site etc.

                <h3>automating</h3>
                <p>
                    This is worth a new column for me although one could argue that automation is just the combination of the former two. But for me th eurge to automate is 
                    almost like a character trait of me. Don't get me wrong. If I am in a hurry and need quick solutions I would also just copy/paste four blocks of 
                    text into an essay. But while doing so I would constantly think about a way to do this more efficiently.
                    I think trying to automate as much of a process lets you really dig deep and understand the underlying concepts. As well as eleminating any kind of errors
                    human or system wise. But of course I know that automating a lot and trusting to much in machines or code can also cause a lot of trouble.
                    So I am well aware that every system of machines and programming needs strong validation.

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>
                I am a 38 year old senior quality working for a medical device manufacturer in berlin. 
                I prefer calling myself a test engineer though, because what I actully do is designing, automating and validating methods for testing various kinds of 
                products. I have spent the last 15 years educating myself in many different fields of engineering, work related as well as privatly.
                By now I can call myself almost addicted to new sources of information, like online tutorials or books. 
                So a big part o my private life and hobbies is also concerned with electronics or especially programming. For me his is some kind of kthinking sports
                like puzzles or crowwsowrd puzzles. Other from that I also want to keep my body in shape I do a lot of different sport activieties, both team and individual.
                To get my head clear I like to tkae my mootorbike for a ride. I like to travel a lot. That's why I also like to travel abroad for my job.
