                <h3>engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    After school I actually wanted to get into the movie business, so I started an internship at a production company for tv documenteries.
                    But a short time in I realised, that I was much more interested in understanding the internal construction of a camera rather than filming with it.
                    I quit the internship and began to study  optical technologies. After my diploma I even continued to advance my knowledge with a master's degree in applied physics.
                    By now I am an engineer by heart and have the strong belief that there is now problem in the world that can't be fixed by a bit of thinking and a lot of trial and error.
                    But jokes aside, ever since my studies I continously improved my engeneering skills in many different fieldd. So although I might not have an expert answer to every question, 
                    at least I will probalbly have heard about a topic somewhere before and know what I have to look up.

            <div class="service">
                <h3>programming</h3>
                <p>
                    As with engineering I didnt't quite find my love for programming right away. In fact I wasn't even a big fan of the programming courses in my engeneering
                    classes. Back in the days programming wasn't as popular and I would find it quite boring spending hours to develop a java program that could solve a binomial equations.
                    This changed when I was working on my master thesis where I wanted to find the blood concentration in a humans body by spectoscopy.
                    I had to write a program that controls the spektometer, read out ccd and does all kinds of data manipulation. So this was when I first realised 
                    what crazy stuff you can do with programming. Ever since I'm hooked and suck in everything in can find about programming. Having basic knowledge
                    in almost every program language there is I find myself most interested in embedded systems which combines my interst for programming an d electrical engeneering.

            <div class="service">
                <h3>automating</h3>
                <p>
                    This is worth a new column for me although one could argue that automation is just the combination of the first two colums. For me though the urge to automate things 
                    almost became like a character trait of me. Don't get me wrong. If I am in a hurry and need quick solutions I would also just copy/paste four blocks of 
                    text into an essay. But while doing so I would constantly think about a way to do this more efficiently.
                    I think trying to automate a process as much as possible really lets you dig deep and understand the underlying concepts. As well as eleminating any kind of errors
                    human or system wise. But of course I know that automating a lot and trusting to much in machines or code can also cause a lot of trouble.
                    So I am well aware that every system of machines and programming needs strong validation.

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>
                I am a 38 year old senior quality working for a medical device manufacturer in berlin. 
                I prefer calling myself a test engineer though, because what I actully do is designing, automating and validating methods for testing various kinds of 
                products. I have spent the last 15 years educating myself in many different fields of engineering, work related as well as privatly.
                By now I can call myself almost addicted to new sources of information, like online tutorials or books. 
                So a big part of my private life and hobbies is also concerned with electronics or especially programming. For me this a kind of recreation where others would 
                solve crossword puzzles. Other from that I also keep my body in shape with a lot of different sport activieties, both team sports and individual.
                To get my head clear I like to take my motorbike for a ride. I like to travel a lot. That's why I also like to travel abroad for my job.
