                    Product quality not only has a major impact on customer satisfaction and company reputation. It will
                    also cause financial damage if not thoroughly investigated throughout the production process.
                    Advanced test methods will guarantee the conformity of product specifications while keeping the
                    throughput high. For me as a test developer the challange is to gain a deep understanding
                    of the product and its functionalities without being an expert in every topic. My broad knowledge in
                    many technical fields helps me with that, as well as always keeping close contact with the
                    development department.

                <h3>test method automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the design and scope have been determined, the goal is to automate as much as possible. Not
                    only does the test duration play a role, but also the elimination of human error.
                    My main competence lies in hardware automation. I started out as a physics engineer writing labiew
                    code to control a huge VUV ellipsometer at the Metrology light source in Berlin. Not only did the
                    software control multiple stepper
                    motors, pumps etc. but also interacted with the undulator and monochromator of the MLS. I continued
                    with LabVIEW code for testing high frequency trandsucer in optical data transmission, but also
                    continued studying other programming languages
                    mostly out of own interest. After obtaining profound knoledge in most of the common languages I
                    recently started to deep dive into PLC sprogramming with the help of structured test, which again is
                    a field oon its own.

            <p>I am a typical engineer, who strongly believes that every problem must have a solution. One just has to
                put the effort and dedication into finding it. Also the first attempt doesn't always have to be perfect
                and beautiful.
                It just has to get the job done and gudie you in the right direction. As you learn more and more about a
                topic you will find
                more beautiful solutions and finally the perfect one.</p>
