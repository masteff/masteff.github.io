            Having worked in two companies related to printed circuit boards I learned a lot about the tevchnical aspects as well as the quality aspects.
            When one of our supplier product engineers retired I even jumped in an took this part of the job additionally to my other job.
            So although I understand that designing schematics and routing PCBs is an artform itself I still try to keep myself updated in this field.
            and occasionally try it myself. And although I know that I am not an expert I think its mandytory or really helps to be able to at least create
            small circuit boards myself. They always look beter than cable salad and of course are a lot mor reliable.
        </p>

            So in this project I created a board which is based on the arduino design. I wouldnt wanna say that I can think of all of this myself. But I understand all o the circuits.
            And the good part about electronics is that nowaydays everything was made before and It is easy to find schematics and pcbs online which one could use as a starting point And
            maybe improve from there.

        <p>
            For this I also tried to construct most of the parts myself and dont rely too much of things I find online. This is quite an exhasuting work but you learn a lot about the
            parts, about there dimesnsions, their specifications and what else one shoul know.
